# Spherical Harmonics Module

## Introduction

Spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a sphere. They are widely used in physics, chemistry, and engineering, particularly in solving problems with spherical symmetry, such as the Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen atom.

This Python module provides an implementation of spherical harmonics using associated Legendre polynomials. The implementation is optimized using Numba for performance and includes a comparison with SciPy's `sph_harm` function for validation.

## Theory

### Spherical Harmonics

Spherical harmonics \( Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \) are solutions to the Laplace equation in spherical coordinates. They are defined as:

\[
Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{(2l + 1)}{4\pi} \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}} P_{l}^{m}(\cos \theta) e^{im\phi}
\]

where:
- \( l \) is the degree (azimuthal quantum number),
- \( m \) is the order (magnetic quantum number),
- \( P_{l}^{m} \) is the associated Legendre polynomial,
- \( \theta \) is the polar angle,
- \( \phi \) is the azimuthal angle.

### Associated Legendre Polynomials

The associated Legendre polynomials \( P_{l}^{m}(x) \) are solutions to the associated Legendre differential equation. They are defined as:

\[
P_{l}^{m}(x) = (-1)^m (1 - x^2)^{m/2} \frac{d^m}{dx^m} P_l(x)
\]

where \( P_l(x) \) is the Legendre polynomial of degree \( l \).

The recursive algorithm used in this module computes \( P_{l}^{m}(x) \) efficiently.

## Code Overview

The module consists of the following functions:
1. `factorial(n)`: Computes the factorial of an integer.
2. `associated_legendre(l, m, x)`: Computes the associated Legendre polynomial \( P_{l}^{m}(x) \).
3. `sph_harm(m, l, phi, theta)`: Computes the spherical harmonic \( Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \).
4. `test_specific_case(l, m, theta, phi)`: Compares the custom implementation with SciPy's `sph_harm`.

## Installation

To install the module, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pip install .

### Usage example

```python
import numpy as np
from sph_harm_module import sph_harm

l = 2
m = 1
theta = np.pi / 4
phi = np.pi / 2

Y = sph_harm(m, l, phi, theta)
print(Y)
